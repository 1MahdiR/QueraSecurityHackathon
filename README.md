</p>

This year for the first time I participated in a CTF competition organized by [Quera.org](https://quera.org/) . It had 14 challenges on various categories (web, android, crypto, reverse, etc). We ranked 20 in the scoreboard out of 135 teams. :)

<p>
The competition had a few flaws at designing the challenges but overall it was an amazing contest and it encouraged me to work harder for upcoming competitions.

<br/>


Now... on to the writeups :) <br/>
We didn't solve all the challenges but I will update the writeups when I find the solutions.
If you any questions or suggestions regarding the writeups submit a new issue or make a pull request.
